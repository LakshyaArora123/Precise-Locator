# Precise-Locator

# Features
1)Map Display:
  The website will feature a map displaying key locations, such as buildings, departments, and hostels within the institute.
  The map will be centered on the institute’s location by default.
  
2)Search Functionality:
  Users will be able to search for specific locations (e.g., building names) using a search bar.
  Upon searching, the map will zoom into the location and highlight it.
  
3)Markers:
  Each location on the map (buildings, departments, etc.) will be marked with a pin.
  Markers will be customizable, matching the institute’s theme (e.g., colors or logos).
  
4)Pop-up Information:
  Clicking on a marker will display a pop-up with additional information, such as the building name, description, and coordinates.
  The pop-ups will have links or buttons to external resources, if needed.
  
5)Responsive Design:
  The website will be fully responsive, ensuring proper display and functionality on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
  The map and its features (markers, pop-ups, search) will adjust dynamically to different screen sizes.
  
6)Map Customization:
  The map will allow users to switch between different styles (e.g., terrain, satellite, standard).
  Zoom and pan controls will be available for users to explore the map freely.
  
7)Version Control:
  The website development process will be tracked using Git for version control, with all code pushed to a GitHub repository.
  Version control will help manage changes and collaborate with other developers (if applicable).
  
8)Navigation Bar:
  The website will have a simple navigation bar to switch between pages such as Home, Map, and About.
